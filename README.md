not-a-virtual-machine
=====================

At Caltech, I took a course called CS 11, which is essentially "learn a programming language". The final assignment for the C track was to write a virtual machine. We were given a very basic instruction set, and were supposed to use arrays to implement the stack and registers. But I got bored, so now it compiles it into x86 assembly, drops it into memory, and executes it.

The 'bca' and 'factorial.bca' programs were written by the CS 11 instructors, presumably Michael Vanier.
